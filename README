To clean the object files:

Purpose of program: 
    The purpose of this program is to serve as a refreshment, with practice with standards and header files, trees, traversals, command line arguments, and file
 IO.
    
Outline of main.c program:
    1. main will check the command line args for an input file.
    2. If the file is there, then main will read the file for data.
       If there is no file, the program will prompt the user for the data.
    3. The program will store the data into a tree
    4. After all the data is entered, 3 traversals will be performed:
        -inorder
        -preorder
        -postorder
    5. Each of these traversals will be written to the appropriate output file.
    6. End of the program
